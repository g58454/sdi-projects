<p>The story of a new born spore-ling is a representation of a project that</p>
			<p>I have been wanting to create for sometime.  He is allowed to choose </p>
			<p>wither or not he wants to explore the new world, find out the purpose of </p>
			<p>life, or do nothing. If he stays put and explores he can play with </p>
			<p>surroundings, and he can leave to go find his purpose. If he chooses to </p>
			<p>find his purpose, he can explore, discover, and grow. Lastly, he can </p>
			<p>choose to do nothing.</p>
